title: "Introducing SoundSite"
---

For a while I've been developing a generalized web framework
with Jekyll for record labels to be able to publish their content
using GitHub pages and a domain name. Today is the launch of 1.0,
and it's totally open source and on GitHub. Click the image below
to check out the live demo, and any of the links on that demo
will take you to the GitHub repo.

You can expect documentation and video guides over the course
of the next few days.
