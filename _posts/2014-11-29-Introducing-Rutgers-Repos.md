title: "Introducing Rutgers Repos"
---

This weekend has been the weekend of getting together some resources and
projects into easily consumable and downloaded and usable chunks. Next up,
all of my Rutgers coursework for computer science and more has been collated
into one master GitHub repo and project page. You can click the link below
to pick what you want to download or get instructions for cloning all of it.
