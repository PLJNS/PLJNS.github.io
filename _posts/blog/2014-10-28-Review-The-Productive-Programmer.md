It's a natural obsession for programmers: the more effective code you can
write in a fixed amount of time, the better. This obsession, which
is perhaps better labeled a professional narcissism, is well-indulged
by Neal Ford's *The Productive Programmer*. The book's central theme
is that many of what makes computers highly usable also slows a 
user down, and that by taking inspiration from the way that the
Super Clever People That Made Computers, we can make our use more effective.

Ford's splits the goal of becoming more productive into two parts:
the "mechanics" and the "practice." Mechanics are about actual tools
and code-snippets: using a launcher, a more advanced clipboard, terminal add-ons
for your filesystem navigator, and even code snippets for scripts. 
While some of the software suggestions are a little dated even only a few
years after publication, the take-away message is still intact: he describes
the sorts of interactions you want to seek to have with a computer programmer.

You should avoid using the mouse when possible, you should minimize the
amount of clicks needed when absolutely necessary, you should use searching
to find applications, programs, and you should find a way to allow your
computer to parse commands from your intent. More generally, *The Productive
Programmer* advises you not to repeat yourself: if you tell your computer
to do something, chances are you'll want to do that again later, so automate it,
speed it up, minimize the effort.

The "practice" that Ford describes is oriented towards software development
advice, the sorts of methodologies and development styles that decrease wasted
time. For instance, many if not all development shops use a *version control*
tool, which allows a developer to revert to a version with an important
code-snippet or a working build or whatever it may be. But there are many
more tools and processes which can help equally as much.

My favorite of these was the advice to use a *canonical build machine*. I
have squandered many hours setting up a new machine with old code, finding
libraries and versions of programming languages and getting the right
configuration. Instead, Ford advises you use a machine with has all the
tools and libraries and version required to run your piece of software.
With this sort of machine, it's unambiguous how to run your app, and
you can even image new machines from the canonical machine.

*The Productive Programmer* is an accessible introduction for the ambitious
user/soon-to-be power-user. As should be expected, some of the tools Ford
recommends are a bit dated (though most of them are still around). But the
method and principles Ford exemplifies are simultaneously from a Golden Era
of computing and a good vision for the future.
