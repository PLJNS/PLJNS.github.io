I was a holdout. For three years, I used the magnificent iPhone 4S
as my trusty telephone. When I upgraded from a feature-phone Nokia
handset to an iPhone 4S, all the things I could do made me forget
how I did without a smartphone: get all your emails on-the-go, use the decent
web-browser to do tasks if a computer wasn't around, keep yourself
completely amused in all idle moments. 

A week ago, I picked up the Ridiculously Big iPhoneÂ® and it is *also* one 
of those products that I already can't remember how I did without.

My 4S really complimented an iPad well for some tasks: where the
phone could send a quick message, the tablet could comfortably
guide you through a book. 

This 6 Plus, on the other hand, does not play so well with an iPad.
It demands use, because as big as it is, it *does* fit in your
pocket ... barely, it has a screen that is just shorter than the iPad is wide, 
and it always has Internet connection (and to connect your iPad to 4G is 
quite pricey). It'll send your quick message and then guide you through
that book as you quickly switch to your train-ticket app, or whatever 
else it is you do.

Any media shines on the 6 Plus: it's in your pocket, so you can play
music; it has a massive screen, so you can play games or browse the web
or read a book; the portrait keyboard is well-suited to two-handed use,
so you needn't shy from heavy-input use ...

But there's one thing that totally sucks about the 6 Plus.

Checking the time.

Oh I know, the humanity, you're walking somewhere to do some 
lovely fun activity or *something* and you want to check if
you're late and you have to pull out a 5.5 inch telephone
to find out. How hard.

But seriously, this device isn't great for glance-able
information, using it demands attention. 

But Apple has no need to create the need for a product category
which involves glance-able information.

Right guys?

Right?
