Last night I watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x30DcBfCJRI&list=UUvbkd52RXrTougfow0czKbQ) excellent introductory presentation on software
architecture from George Fairbanks, an author, academic, and software
architect. As a mobile developer fresh out of school, I feel as though
the reliance on frameworks has made my job easier but also tied me
to certain vendors. I see awareness of my code's underlying architecture as a means
of escaping vendor lock-in.
