I'm a hobbyist musician that is a little familiar with how [DAW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation)s work, and today I had a goal of planning and recording a small piece of music. The way I planned the instruments in this small clip was to first play a riff on the guitar through a [loop pedal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(music)), and get a loop of the riff playing over-and-over again through an amplifier. I then jam out a little bit to find a bass line in the lower guitar notes to play over the riff, but still using the guitar and loop pedal to overlay the bass line. Then, using the loop pedal once more, I seek out a melody using the guitar's higher notes, and *also* overlay that with the loop pedal. Finally, I'd jump over to the drum kit, still playing live, and find a suitable rhythm. It's a neat little trick to simulate a full band.

After playing the riff live using a loop pedal and a drum set, I moved to my laptop where I first record the guitar to a click track, add on the bass using a real bass (a luxury I couldn't afford with the loop pedal), add the melody that was previously played with the higher guitar notes on a MIDI synth (another luxury), and mimicked the drum beat with MIDI.

This was a process that took 6 hours and resulted in thirty seconds of this 80s sitcom intro-scene music: [Check it out on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/pljns/30-seconds-of-a-power-pop-riff).
