While in school, I was careful to keep a copious record of all
my work. I did this for a few reasons: to make sure I never
had to repeat myself, to assure that I could continue learning
from the work after the course, and because I forsaw it might
be the resource I wish I had when I was studying. Everything
from my notes for my classes to the source code is available 
for immediate download or cloning from GitHub.
